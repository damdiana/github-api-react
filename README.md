# github-api-react

## About

This is a practice project to learn React and TypeScript. I also used [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to easily create and view the components.

By using the GitHub API, you can see the public repos of a user. Clicking on a repo, allows you to see the issues and commits.

The project is live on GitHub Pages: https://damdiana.github.io/github-api-react/

## Running the project

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Run the project locally via `npm run dev`
3. If you want to build the project run `npm run build`

## Storybook

1. Run `npm run storybook`
